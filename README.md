2nd Semester Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Assessment of Learning Project

For our final project in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course, we were asked to design a user interface for a toy shop called HiToyz. My approach to this project was to design a toy shop website targetting teenagers and young adults, taking inspiration from existing online figurine stores.
